# abandoned-art-archive

Matt Pearson ([@zenbullets](https://twitter.com/zenbullets)) created 100 works of
"abandoned art" using generative art techniques. Neither of his sites exists anymore, so I
am copying it from the[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170901150359/http://abandonedart.org/) and storing it here.

I think this is worthwhile because:
* I'm working through his book, [Generative Art](https://www.manning.com/books/generative-art)
* His work attracted [some attention](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ypnqkg/100-abandoned-artworks).
